## Executive Summary

The WidgetDropdown component is the primary interface users interact with to add widgets to their dashboards. This PRD outlines a comprehensive redesign from a basic 384px dropdown to a large-scale, Mac Finder-style interface featuring three-column navigation, advanced filtering (search, author, provider), and rich widget metadata display.

**Key Goals:**

-   Reduce time to add widget from ~15s to <10s
-   Enable discovery by author and provider requirements
-   Prepare foundation for future marketplace/registry integration
-   Create polished, professional widget selection experience

**Success Criteria:**

-   90%+ user satisfaction on "Easy to find and add widgets"
-   Users can find widget by author in <5 seconds
-   Users can filter by provider in <3 seconds

---

## Context & Background

### Problem Statement

The current WidgetDropdown implementation (404 lines, 384px wide inline dropdown) provides basic widget selection but lacks:

-   Advanced filtering capabilities (no author or provider filters)
-   Comprehensive widget information display
-   Professional, polished visual design
-   Scalability for future marketplace integration

**Current Pain Points:**

1. **Limited Discovery:** Search only matches widget name/key, not description or metadata
2. **No Author Filtering:** Users cannot filter widgets by creator
3. **No Provider Filtering:** Cannot find widgets without provider requirements or by specific provider
4. **Minimal Information:** Limited widget details before adding (only icon + name + provider indicator)
5. **Small Interface:** 384px width feels cramped and unprofessional
6. **No Registry Support:** No foundation for future marketplace browsing

### Current Implementation

**File:** `./src/Components/Layout/Builder/Enhanced/WidgetDropdown.js`

**Key Features:**

-   Type filter (widgets only)
-   Search filter (name/key matching)
-   Recent widgets section (localStorage, top 3)
-   Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter to select)
-   384px (w-96) centered modal with backdrop

**Data Source:**

-   `ComponentManager.map()` - Returns all registered widgets
-   Widget metadata: name, key, type, workspace, description, icon, providers[], userConfig, styles, events

### Target Users

1. **Dashboard Creator (Sarah)** - Builds dashboards regularly, needs quick widget discovery
2. **Widget Curator (Alex)** - Manages installed widgets, filters by providers and authors
3. **Explorer (Jordan)** - Browses available widgets, wants detailed info before committing

### Data Flow

```
1. User opens modal
   ↓
2. EnhancedWidgetDropdown component mounts
   ↓
3. Fetch installed widgets from ComponentManager.map()
   ↓
4. Set initial state:
   - selectedSource: "Installed"
   - widgets: [array of widget objects]
   - filteredWidgets: [same array, unfiltered]
   - selectedWidget: null
   - searchQuery: ""
   - authorFilter: "All Authors"
   - providerFilter: "All Providers"
   ↓
5. User interacts with filters
   ↓
6. Update state (searchQuery, authorFilter, or providerFilter)
   ↓
7. Re-compute filteredWidgets using AND logic:
   - Filter by search (matches name, key, description)
   - Filter by author (matches workspace)
   - Filter by provider (matches provider type or "none")
   ↓
8. Update WidgetListColumn with filteredWidgets
   ↓
9. User selects widget from list
   ↓
10. Update selectedWidget state
    ↓
11. DetailsColumn displays selectedWidget metadata
    ↓
12. User clicks "Add to Dashboard"
    ↓
13. Call onSelectWidget(selectedWidget) callback
    ↓
14. Close modal
```

### Technology Choices

**Component Library:**

-   **CRITICAL:** Use existing dash-react components exclusively (Panel, Button, Modal, InputText, etc.)
-   **Theme Integration:** All components MUST use ThemeContext to respect user's selected theme
-   **Required Components from dash-react:**
    -   `Modal` - Base modal wrapper
    -   `Panel` / `Panel2` / `Panel3` - Column containers and sections
    -   `Button` - "Add to Dashboard" button
    -   `InputText` - Search input
    -   `SelectMenu` - Author and Provider filter dropdowns
    -   `Heading` / `SubHeading` - Typography
    -   Typography components for text rendering
-   **Why dash-react components:**
    -   Automatic theme integration (light/dark mode support)
    -   Consistent styling with rest of application
    -   Built-in responsive behavior
    -   Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard support)

**State Management:**

-   Local component state (useState hooks)
-   Access ThemeContext via `useContext(ThemeContext)` for currentTheme
-   No need for global state (Redux/Context) for widget list data

**Data Fetching:**

-   Synchronous: `ComponentManager.map()` for installed widgets
-   Asynchronous stub: `Promise.resolve([])` for registry (future)

**Filtering Logic:**

-   Pure JavaScript array methods (filter, some, includes)
-   Debounced search input (lodash.debounce or custom hook)

**Performance Optimizations:**

-   Memoized filter functions (useMemo)
-   Virtualized scrolling (react-window) if >100 widgets (future)
-   Debounced search (150ms delay)

## Phase 2 Enhancements: Configure Before Add

### Status Update

**Phase 1:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (Three-column layout, filtering, basic widget selection)

**Phase 2:** 📋 **PLANNED** (Configure providers and userConfig before adding widget)

### Overview

Phase 2 transforms the EnhancedWidgetDropdown from a selection interface into a complete "configure and add" workflow. Instead of adding widgets first and configuring them later, users can now configure all provider credentials and widget settings before adding the widget to their dashboard.

**Key Goals:**

-   Reduce post-add configuration steps from 3-5 to 0
-   Enable quick re-use of frequently-used widgets with saved configurations
-   Streamline layout from 3 columns to 2 columns for better space utilization
-   Provide responsive design for smaller screens (<1024px)

**Success Metrics:**

-   Time to add configured widget: <15 seconds (includes provider and config setup)
-   Recent widgets re-add time: <3 seconds (one-click from history)
-   Provider configuration success rate: >95% (before widget addition)
-   User satisfaction with "configure before add" workflow: >90%

### Phase 2 Feature Requirements

#### 1. Layout Simplification: 3-Column → 2-Column

**Current Layout (Phase 1):**

```
┌───────────┬────────────┬─────────────┐
│ Source    │ Widget     │ Details     │
│ Installed │ List       │             │
│ Discover  │            │             │
└───────────┴────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**New Layout (Phase 2):**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Search] [Author▼] [Provider▼] [Source▼: Installed] │
├──────────────┬──────────────────────┤
│ Widget List  │ Configure & Add      │
│              │                      │
│ • Widget 1   │ 📦 Widget Name       │
│ • Widget 2   │ by Author            │
│              │                      │
│              │ ⚙️ PROVIDERS         │
│              │ Slack: [Select▼]     │
│              │                      │
│              │ ⚙️ CONFIGURATION     │
│              │ Title: [_____]       │
│              │ SubTitle: [_____]    │
│              │                      │
│              │ [Add to Dashboard]   │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

**FR-2.1: Source Selector Moved to Filter Bar**

-   Move "Installed/Discover" from left column to filter bar (rightmost position)
-   Dropdown format instead of column selection
-   Options: "Installed" (default), "Discover"
-   Works in combination with other filters

**FR-2.2: Two-Column Layout**

-   Column 1: Widget List (50% width)
-   Column 2: Configure & Add Panel (50% width)
-   Filters: Horizontal bar above columns (Search | Author | Provider | Source)

**FR-2.2.1: Widget List Ordering and Prioritization**

-   Prioritize "Installed" widgets over "Discover" widgets in search results
-   When Source filter shows combined results (if "All Sources" option is implemented):
    -   Installed widgets appear first (alphabetically sorted within group)
    -   Then Discover/Registry widgets (alphabetically sorted within group)
-   Maintains alphabetical sorting within each source group
-   Optional visual separator between Installed and Discover sections (divider line or section heading)
-   Current implementation (Phase 1): Only one source shown at a time, no mixing
-   Future enhancement: "All Sources" filter option to show combined, prioritized list

**FR-2.3: Responsive Design**

Large screens (≥1024px):

```
┌────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┐
│ Description    │ [Search] [Author] [Provider] [Source] │
│ (1/3)          ├──────────────┬───────────────────┤
│                │ Widget List  │ Configure & Add   │
│ Add Widget to  │              │                   │
│ Dashboard      │ • Widget 1   │ 📦 Widget Name    │
│                │ • Widget 2   │                   │
│ Browse and...  │              │ PROVIDERS         │
│                │              │ CONFIGURATION     │
└────────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

Small screens (<1024px):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Search] [Author] [Provider] [Source]    │
├────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤
│ Widget List    │ Configure & Add         │
│                │                         │
│ • Widget 1     │ 📦 Widget Name          │
│ • Widget 2     │                         │
│                │ PROVIDERS               │
│                │ CONFIGURATION           │
└────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**

-   Use Tailwind responsive utility: `hidden lg:flex` on left descriptive area
-   Adjust widget navigation width: `w-full lg:w-2/3`
-   Modal remains centered and maintains `w-11/12 xl:w-5/6` width
-   Smooth CSS transitions when toggling visibility

#### 2. Provider Configuration in Details Panel

**FR-3.1: Provider Selection Dropdowns**

**Current Flow (Phase 1):**

1. User clicks "Add to Dashboard"
2. Widget added with missing providers
3. ProviderBadge shows "Configure" button
4. User clicks badge → ProviderSelector modal opens
5. User selects/creates provider

**New Flow (Phase 2):**

1. User selects widget
2. Details panel shows provider dropdowns
3. User selects existing provider OR clicks "Create New"
4. If "Create New" → ProviderForm inline (or mini-modal)
5. User clicks "Add to Dashboard" → widget added with providers configured

**UI Components:**

-   Section heading: "REQUIRED PROVIDERS"
-   For each required provider:
    -   Provider type label (e.g., "Slack")
    -   Dropdown select component:
        -   Option: "-- Select Provider --" (placeholder)
        -   Options: List of existing providers of matching type (e.g., "slack-prod", "slack-dev")
        -   Option: "+ Create New {type}" (special value: `__create_new__`)
    -   Required indicator (red text) if provider is required and not selected
    -   Validation: Show error if required provider not selected before adding

**State Management:**

```javascript
const [selectedProviders, setSelectedProviders] = useState({});
// { "slack": "slack-prod", "algolia": "algolia-dev" }

const [showProviderForm, setShowProviderForm] = useState(null);
// { type: "slack", credentialSchema: {...} } when creating new

const handleProviderSelect = (providerType, providerName) => {
    if (providerName === "__create_new__") {
        setShowProviderForm({
            type: providerType,
            credentialSchema: selectedWidget.providers.find(
                (p) => p.type === providerType
            ).credentialSchema,
        });
    } else {
        setSelectedProviders({
            ...selectedProviders,
            [providerType]: providerName,
        });
    }
};
```

**FR-3.2: Inline Provider Creation**

-   When user selects "+ Create New {type}":
    -   Show ProviderForm component inline or as mini-modal overlay
    -   Reuse existing ProviderForm component from `./src/Components/Provider/ProviderForm.js`
    -   User fills credential fields (OAuth token, workspace URL, etc.)
    -   On save:
        -   Call `dashApi.saveProvider(providerData)`
        -   Update AppContext.providers list
        -   Auto-select newly created provider in dropdown
        -   Close provider form
        -   Return focus to details panel

**FR-3.3: Provider Validation**

-   Before allowing "Add to Dashboard":
    -   Check all required providers have selections
    -   Show validation errors if missing
    -   Disable "Add to Dashboard" button if validation fails
    -   Visual indicators (red border, error text) for incomplete fields

#### 3. userConfig Fields in Details Panel

**FR-4.1: Configuration Fields Section**

-   Section heading: "CONFIGURATION"
-   Display all userConfig fields from widget definition
-   For each field:
    -   Field label (use `displayName` or fallback to `key`)
    -   Required indicator (\*) if field is required
    -   Input component based on field type:
        -   `text`: Text input field
        -   `number`: Number input field
        -   `select`: Dropdown with options
        -   `boolean`: Checkbox or toggle
    -   Placeholder or default value display
    -   Instructions text (if provided in field config)
-   Empty state: "This widget has no configuration options." (hide section entirely)

**UI Components:**

```javascript
// Text field example
<div className="space-y-1">
    <label className="text-sm font-medium">
        Title <span className="text-red-400">*</span>
    </label>
    <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="My Dashboard"
        value={userConfigValues["title"] || ""}
        onChange={(e) => handleConfigChange("title", e.target.value)}
        className="w-full px-3 py-2 rounded text-sm bg-gray-700 border"
    />
    <p className="text-xs text-gray-400">
        The title displayed at the top of the widget
    </p>
</div>
```

**State Management:**

```javascript
const [userConfigValues, setUserConfigValues] = useState({});
// { "title": "My Custom Title", "subTitle": "Custom subtitle" }

const handleConfigChange = (key, value) => {
    setUserConfigValues({ ...userConfigValues, [key]: value });
};
```

**FR-4.2: Configuration Validation**

-   Before allowing "Add to Dashboard":
    -   Check all required userConfig fields are filled
    -   Validate field types (number fields contain numbers, etc.)
    -   Show validation errors if missing or invalid
    -   Disable "Add to Dashboard" button if validation fails
    -   Visual indicators for incomplete/invalid fields

**FR-4.3: Add to Dashboard with Configuration**

```javascript
const handleAddWidget = () => {
    // Validate providers
    if (!validateProviders()) {
        // Show error message
        return;
    }

    // Validate userConfig
    if (!validateUserConfig()) {
        // Show error message
        return;
    }

    // Save to recent widgets
    saveToRecent(selectedWidget, selectedProviders, userConfigValues);

    // Call parent callback with full configuration
    onSelectWidget({
        ...selectedWidget,
        selectedProviders, // Provider selections
        userConfigValues, // User configuration
    });

    // Close modal
    onClose();
};
```

#### 4. Recent Widgets Feature

**FR-5.1: Recent Widgets Storage**

**localStorage Structure:**

```javascript
// Key: "recentWidgets"
[
    {
        widgetKey: "MyFirstWidgetWidget",
        timestamp: 1699564800000,
        providers: {
            slack: "slack-prod",
            algolia: "algolia-dev",
        },
        userConfig: {
            title: "My Dashboard",
            subTitle: "Analytics",
        },
    },
    // ... max 10 items
];
```

**Storage Logic:**

-   Track last 10 recently added widgets
-   Store widget key + providers + userConfig
-   Newest widgets at front of array
-   Deduplicate by widget key (update timestamp if re-added)
-   Persist across sessions
-   Clear on logout (optional)

**FR-5.2: Recent Widgets UI Display**

-   Section heading: "RECENT WIDGETS" (at top of Widget List column)
-   Show last 3-5 recently added widgets
-   Visual indicator: Clock icon (🕒) or "Recent" badge
-   Separated from main widget list with divider/border
-   Click behavior: Auto-populate providers and userConfig in details panel

**UI Components:**

```javascript
{
    recentWidgets.length > 0 && (
        <div className="mb-3 border-b border-gray-700 pb-3">
            <Paragraph className="text-xs font-semibold text-gray-400 mb-2 px-2">
                RECENT WIDGETS
            </Paragraph>
            <Menu3 scrollable={false} padding={true}>
                {recentWidgets.map((widget) => (
                    <MenuItem3
                        key={widget.key}
                        onClick={() => handleRecentClick(widget)}
                        selected={selectedWidget?.key === widget.key}
                    >
                        <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
                            <span className="text-xs">🕒</span>
                            <div className="text-sm font-medium">
                                {widget.name}
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </MenuItem3>
                ))}
            </Menu3>
        </div>
    );
}
```

**FR-5.3: Recent Widgets Interaction**

-   Click on recent widget:
    -   Load widget data
    -   Pre-populate `selectedProviders` from recent entry
    -   Pre-populate `userConfigValues` from recent entry
    -   Display in details panel with all fields filled
    -   User can modify and re-add, or add as-is
-   Result: One-click widget addition with saved configuration (~3 seconds)

**Implementation:**

```javascript
const loadRecentWidgets = () => {
    const recent = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("recentWidgets") || "[]");
    return recent.slice(0, 5).map((entry) => {
        const widget = allWidgets[entry.widgetKey];
        return {
            ...widget,
            savedProviders: entry.providers,
            savedUserConfig: entry.userConfig,
        };
    });
};

const handleRecentClick = (recentWidget) => {
    setSelectedWidget(recentWidget);
    setSelectedProviders(recentWidget.savedProviders || {});
    setUserConfigValues(recentWidget.savedUserConfig || {});
};
```

### Phase 2 User Stories

**US-P2-001: Configure Provider Before Adding Widget**

-   **I want to** see the widget selector adapt to my screen size
-   **So that** I can use the feature effectively without excessive scrolling

**Acceptance Criteria:**

-   ✅ On large screens (≥1024px): Left descriptive area visible (1/3), navigation (2/3)
-   ✅ On small screens (<1024px): Left descriptive area hidden, navigation full width
-   ✅ Transition is smooth and automatic based on viewport width
-   ✅ Modal remains centered and maintains responsive width

### Phase 2 Data Flow

```
1. User selects widget from list
   ↓
2. Details panel shows:
   - Widget info (icon, name, author, description)
   - Provider dropdowns (if widget requires providers)
   - userConfig fields (if widget has userConfig)
   ↓
3. User selects providers OR clicks "Create New"
   ↓
4a. If "Create New": Show ProviderForm (inline or modal)
    → User fills credentials → Save to API → Update context → Auto-select
   ↓
4b. User fills userConfig fields (title, subtitle, etc.)
   ↓
5. User clicks "Add to Dashboard"
   ↓
6. Validation:
   - All required providers selected? ✓
   - All required userConfig fields filled? ✓
   ↓
7. If valid:
   - Save to recent widgets (localStorage)
   - Call onSelectWidget({ widget, selectedProviders, userConfigValues })
   - Parent (LayoutBuilder) creates widget instance with config
   - Close modal
   ↓
8. If invalid:
   - Show validation errors
   - Highlight missing fields
   - Keep modal open
```

### Phase 2 Integration Points

**Existing Components to Reuse:**

-   `./src/Components/Provider/ProviderSelector.js` - Provider selection modal (reference for patterns)
-   `./src/Components/Provider/ProviderForm.js` - Provider creation form (reuse directly)

## Appendix

### Widget Data Model Reference

```javascript
{
  // Core Metadata
  key: string,               // Unique widget identifier (e.g., "analytics-widget")
  name: string,              // Display name (e.g., "Analytics Dashboard")
  type: "widget",            // Component type (always "widget")
  workspace: string,         // Workspace namespace
  author: string,            // Author or organization name (optional, used for filtering)
  description: string,       // Optional description
  icon: string,              // Unicode emoji icon (e.g., "📊")

  // Provider Requirements
  providers: [               // Array of required providers
    {
      type: string,          // Provider type (e.g., "slack", "algolia")
      required: boolean,     // Is provider required or optional?
      credentialSchema: {    // Credential requirements
        // Provider-specific fields
        // e.g., { oauthToken: "string", workspaceUrl: "string" }
      }
    }
  ],

  eventHandlers: [],         // Event handler definitions
  canHaveChildren: boolean,  // Can widget contain child widgets?
}
```

### Filter Logic Pseudocode

```javascript
function filterWidgets(widgets, searchQuery, authorFilter, providerFilter) {
    return widgets.filter((widget) => {
        // Search filter (OR across fields)
        const matchesSearch =
            searchQuery === "" ||
            widget.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
            widget.key.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
            (widget.description &&
                widget.description
                    .toLowerCase()
                    .includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()));

        // Author filter
        const matchesAuthor =
            authorFilter === "All Authors" || widget.workspace === authorFilter;

        // Provider filter
        let matchesProvider = true;
        if (providerFilter === "None") {
            matchesProvider = widget.providers.length === 0;
        } else if (providerFilter !== "All Providers") {
            matchesProvider = widget.providers.some(
                (p) => p.type === providerFilter
